REAL ESTATE ANALYTICS PROJECT â€” FINAL CLIENT REPORT
============================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------
This script generates the final consolidated client report view 
(`gold.report_clients`) that profiles client performance, 
engagement, and value within the Real Estate Data Warehouse.  
It integrates key metrics from transactional and dimensional data 
to support strategic decision-making, client segmentation, 
and business intelligence reporting.

------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECTIVES
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Aggregate client-level sales and engagement data.  
2. Derive key customer metrics including total sales, properties sold,  
   lifespan, and recency.  
3. Segment clients into categories (VIP, Regular, New) based on  
   performance thresholds.  
4. Compute customer monthly averages and active duration for retention analysis.  
5. Provide a unified, query-ready reporting view for business insights.

------------------------------------------------------------
DATA SOURCE
------------------------------------------------------------
- gold.fact_sales  
- gold.dim_clients  

------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------
This final deliverable represents the culmination of the 
data analysis workflow. It transforms analytical results into 
an operational business report suitable for dashboards and 
client relationship management (CRM) insights.
