REAL ESTATE ANALYTICS PROJECT â€” EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
============================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------
This SQL script performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
on the Real Estate Data Warehouse (Gold Layer). The goal is to uncover 
key insights into property sales performance, agent activity, and 
regional revenue trends.

------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECTIVES
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Explore database structure and dimensions (states, cities, property types, agencies).  
2. Compute key business measures such as total revenue, average sale price, and sales volume.  
3. Perform magnitude analysis to compare performance across different dimensions.  
4. Apply ranking analysis to identify top-performing regions, property types, and agencies.  
5. Establish a foundation for advanced trend and predictive analytics.

------------------------------------------------------------
DATA SOURCE
------------------------------------------------------------
- gold.fact_sales  
- gold.dim_properties  
- gold.dim_clients  

------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------
This script focuses on descriptive and diagnostic analytics.
All measures are formatted for readability, and results are grouped
by relevant dimensions to support reporting and visualization.
