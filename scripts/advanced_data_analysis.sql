REAL ESTATE ANALYTICS PROJECT â€” ADVANCED DATA ANALYTICS
============================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------
This SQL script focuses on advanced analytical techniques applied 
to the Real Estate Data Warehouse (Gold Layer). The purpose is to 
derive deeper insights into sales performance, market behavior, 
and property trends across time, geography, and categories.

------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECTIVES
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Analyze year-over-year and month-over-month sales trends.  
2. Compute cumulative and running totals for sales revenue and averages.  
3. Evaluate property type performance relative to historical and average benchmarks.  
4. Perform part-to-whole analysis to measure contribution by property category.  
5. Segment property sales based on pricing ranges for better market understanding.

------------------------------------------------------------
DATA SOURCE
------------------------------------------------------------
- gold.fact_sales  
- gold.dim_properties  

------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------
This analysis expands on descriptive analytics by introducing 
trend, comparative, and segmentation insights. It leverages 
advanced SQL functions such as CTEs, window functions, 
and conditional logic for dynamic performance analysis.
